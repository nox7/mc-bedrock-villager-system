# Village System Behavior and Resource Pack
A Minecraft Bedrock Behavior Pack and Texture Pack that adds villagers with roles. Create living, breathing villages; towns; or kingdoms with villagers that have schedules and jobs and interact with each other. For example, general townspeople may need to visit the Merchant villagers for supplies during the day; or random villagers (when evening comes upon them) will want to visit the tavern before they go to bed for the evening.

An experimental "unloaded chunk manager" works to manage these happenings even when you are no longer simulating chunks.

All code uses Microsoft's official Bedrock JavaScript API - no custom modding required.

## Additions

### NPCs 
- Woodcutter: Craft a Woodcutter Manager block and place it where you would like a woodcutter to spawn. Make sure to have a chest adjacent. This woodcutter will then roam and cut trees and replant them - adding the obtained logs to the chest adjacent to his Woodcutter Manager block.

### Recipes
- Leather can be obtained by smelting Rotten Flesh in a furnace
